# SlideStack

A tool for programmers to create, present, and share interactive slideshows. Embeddable editors give presenters and students the ability to write, run, and communicate their code in real-time directly from the presentation.

## Creating a classes

A teacher who wants to give a lecture to a certain set of students and under a specific topic should make a class.  To do this, the user can go to the "Classes as Teacher" tab and click the "Create A Class" button.  This will let the user give the class a name and a brief description.

## Adding students to a class

To add students to the class, the teacher can move to the "Students" tab on the class page to search for any registered SlideStack user and add him or her to the class with a simple click.

## How to create and edit a presentation

Creating a presentation in SlideStack is a simple process.  The user can click on "Create A Presentation", enter a title, and hit "create" to start making the presentation.  The presentation is edited using Markdown.  If unfamiliar with how to use Markdown, see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/.  SlideStack has custom commands to add more to the quality of the presentation:
- $$$ = new slide
- @ editor @ = adds a code editor
- @ console @ = add an emulated console after the editor to display output
- @ fiddle @ = adds a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript viewer and editor
- @ notes @ = adds notes the teacher can see when prensenting

## Student learning tools

SlideStack helps a teacher's lecture become less of an introduction to a topic and more of an immersive learning process.  During the lecture, students have the teacher's presentation on their screen as it moves along with the teacher.  If the student wants to go at his or her own pace, they have the option to pause the lecture and view any slide on their own screen.  


The teacher can call on a student to let him or her edit the teacher's code and broadcast the changes to the rest of the class.  If students are confused at any point, they can submit a question to the teacher directly from the presentation view.  Students have the option to ask the question anonymously in case they find their question embarrassing.  Remember there is no such thing as a stupid question!  If the students are confused but don't have any specific question, they have the option to toggle the Confuse-O-Meter switch.  This will update on the teacher's screen and will show the percentage of the class that is confused.
