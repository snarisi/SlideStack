# SlideStack

A tool for programmers to create, present, and share interactive slideshows. Embeddable editors give presenters and students the ability to write, run, and communicate their code in real-time directly from the presentation.

## Creating a classes

A teacher who wants to give a lecture to a certain set of students and under a specific topic should make a class.  To do this, the user can go to the "Classes as Teacher" tab and click the "Create A Class" button.  This will give the user the ability to give the class a name and a brief description.

## Adding students to a class

To add students to the class, the teacher can search for any user signed up on SlideStack in the "Students" tab on the class page and add that student with a simple click.

## How to create and edit a presentation

Creating a presentation in SlideStack was designed to be a simple process.  The user can click on "Create A Presentation", give it a title, and hit "create" to start making the presentation.  The presentation is edited using Markdown.  If unfamiliar with how to use Markdown, see https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/.  SlideStack has custom commands to add more to the quality of the presentation:
- $$$ = new slide
- @ editor @ = adds a code editor
- @ console @ = add after the editor to show output of the code
- @ fiddle @ = adds a HTML, CSS, and JavaScript viewer and editor
- @ notes @ = add notes for the teacher when presenting

## Student learning tools

SlideStack helps a teacher's lecture become less of an introduction to a topic and more of an immersive learning process.  During the lecture, students have the teacher's presentation on their screen as it moves along with the teacher.  If the student wants to go at his or her own pace, they have the option to pause the lecture and view any slide on their own screen.  The teacher can call on a student in SlideStack so that way the student can show and edit code in one of the editors on the teacher's big screen in front of the class.  If the student is confused at any point, they can ask a question on the site that will notify the teacher on SlideStack.  The student has the option to ask the question anonymously in case they find their question embarrassing.  Remember there is no such thing as a stupid question!  If the students are confused but don't have any specific question, they have the option to toggle the Confuse-O-Meter switch.  This will update on the teacher's screen and will show the percentage of the class that is confused.
